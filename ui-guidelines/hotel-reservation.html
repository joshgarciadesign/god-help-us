                      <h5>Terms used in this Agreement</h5>
                      <p>The terms "we", "us", "our" and "EAN" refer to EAN.COM L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, (collectively the “EAN Companies”). The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website
                        and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.</p>
                      <h5>Purpose of this Website</h5>
                      <p>This Website is provided solely to assist you to gather travel information, determine the availability of travel-related goods and services, make legitimate reservations or otherwise transact business with travel suppliers, and for
                        no other purposes.</p>
                      <p>This Website (“Website”) is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms of Use” or “Agreement"). Please read the Terms of
                        Use carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the
                        Website. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms of Use then in force shall apply. If you do not
                        agree to the Terms of Use, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents. </p>
                      <h5>Use of the Website</h5>
                      <p>As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that</p>
                      <ol class="ol-numbered">
                        <li>you are at least 18 years of age; </li>
                        <li>you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation; </li>

                      <h5>DISPUTES</h5>
                      <p>Expedia is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.</p>
                      <p>You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy
                        Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Customer Support. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.</p>
                      <p><strong>Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court</strong>, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against
                        us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms
                        of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration.</p>
                      <p><strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would.</strong></p>
                      <p>Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration
                        and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees,
                        unless the arbitrator determines your Claims are frivolous. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
                      <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Expedia Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Expedia, Inc., 333 108th Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004. If we request arbitration
                        against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. A party requesting arbitration must also provide a copy of the request to the AAA, at Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite
                        100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 or online at www.adr.org or at any AAA office.</p>
                      <p><strong>Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong> If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration
                        <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial</strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.</p>

                          <ul class="ul-disc">
                            <li>Do not submit any photos or materials that are illegal, obscene, pornographic, profane, vulgar, offensive or insulting.</li>
                            <li>Do not submit photos or materials that invade the privacy or violate any personal right of any person or entity.</li>

                      <h5>Prices</h5>
                      <p>You acknowledge that the authorities in certain countries may impose certain additional taxes (tourist tax, etc), which have to be paid locally. You are exclusively responsible for paying such additional taxes.</p>
                      <p>You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amount we retain for our services, we do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The hotel suppliers invoice us for
                        certain charges, including, where appropriate, tax amounts. The hotel suppliers remit the applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. The tax recovery charges which we charge you on prepaid hotel transactions represent
                        the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc) that we pay to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the rental of the room. They do not represent a collection of taxes from you for
                        us to remit to the applicable tax authorities. The actual tax amounts paid by us to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual
                        use of the hotel by our customers. We retain our service fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Our service fees vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.</p>
                      <p>EAN does not act as co-vendor with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location.</p>
                      <p>Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (facilitation fee and/or service fee) in certain jurisdictions. For hotel stays in New York State, but outside of New York City,
                        for example, tax recovery charges, as described above, are collected to cover the taxes due on the rent received by the hotel for the room and there is no local hotel occupancy tax due on our services. The actual tax amounts on
                        our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay.</p>
                      <h5>Prepaid Hotel Reservations</h5>
                      <p>EAN’s corporate affiliates pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotels to facilitate the booking of reservations on your behalf. You also acknowledge that EAN provides you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for
                        a consideration (the “facilitation fee.”) You authorize EAN to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges and service fees. You agree that
                        your credit card will be charged for the total reservation price by Travel Partner Exchange or another member of the EAN Companies doing business as EAN.</p>
                      <p>You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you will be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before
                        the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival, you will be subject to a charge equal to applicable nightly rates, tax recovery
                        charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with us no later than the date
                        of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation. You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some reservations cannot be changed or cancelled after they are
                        made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.</p>
                      <p>You may not book reservations for more than 8 rooms online for the same hotel/stay dates. If we determine that you have booked reservations for more than 8 rooms in total in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations,
                        and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book reservations for 9 or more rooms, you must contact our group travel specialists by phone
                        at (800) 916-3290 or by filling out the group travel form online. One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay
                        a nonrefundable deposit.</p>
                      <h5>Pay Now or Pay Later Details</h5>
                      <p>With certain hotels, you may be presented with the option to pay online now or pay later at the hotel. If you select the “Pay Online Now” option, EAN will charge the amount to your credit card in US dollars immediately. If you select
                        “Pay Later at the Hotel”, the hotel will charge your credit card in the local currency at the time of your stay. Please note that taxes and fees vary between the two payment options. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change
                        in the time between booking and stay. EAN coupons may only be applied to "Pay Online Now" bookings. </p>
                      <h5>International Travel</h5>
                      <p>You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements
                        are met. EAN has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to
                        booking travel to international destinations.</p>
                      <p>Passport and Visa: You must consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for this information. Requirements may change and you should check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. We accept no liability if you are refused
                        entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting
                        through. This includes all stops made by the aircraft, even if you do not leave the aircraft or airport.</p>
                      <p>Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current recommendations before you depart. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the
                        recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip.</p>
                      <p>Disinsection: Although not common, most countries reserve the right to disinsect aircraft if there is a perceived threat to public health, agriculture or environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation
                        Organization have approved the following disinsection procedures: (1) spray the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or (2) treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual insecticide
                        while passengers are not on board. For more information, see: http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.htm</p>
                      <p>BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND ARE NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT

                      <p>If a currency converter is available on this website, currency rates are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not verified as accurate, and actual rates may vary. Currency quotes
                        are not updated every day. You are advised to check the date on the currency converter feature for the day that currency was last updated. The information supplied by this application is believed to be accurate, but the EAN Companies,

                      <h5>Payments and Fees</h5>
                      <p>In the event that your payment is taken at the time of booking, the company taking that payment and charging your credit card will be Travel Partner Exchange or another member of the EAN Companies doing business as EAN, who takes
                        such payment on behalf of the company providing the travel service or the travel service provider directly. Some bank and card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location
                        (as defined by the card brand, e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee is determined solely by the bank or other agency processing
                        the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. When applied by the card issuer, the fees will be listed separately from the transaction amount on a credit or debit card statement.
                        This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees
                        or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.</p>
